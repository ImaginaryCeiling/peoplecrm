# Hello 
I've spent quite a bit of time looking for a good and easy way to keep track of all the cool people I meet

How do we solve that?

to get started, I would suggest reading the first post on my website [here](arnavchauhan.com/blog/peoplecrm). It marks the start of why I think this needs to happen. It also adds context to the rest of this.

I'm thinking out loud here. Here's how it's going to work:
In the thoughts folder, i keep things that I think about for what to do next, also just as a braindump. the idea is that anyone can track my journey along creating this.

If you want my high level thoughts as to what this could become:
I feel like throughout working on this, I'm going to figure out the intricaces of human connection as a whole. That sounds like a whole bunch of nothingness and in a way it is; the concept is too abstract at the moment to put in words as it is. Regardless, I think whatever happens here I'll just learn a lot more about people as a whole. The problem isn't novel, but everyone faces it. Let's see what we can make to fix it :)

Next Up: figure out how to make this easy to use? and digest. I would rather it be something I actually want to use which in turn would make it so that it results in things that you actually want to read.
sidenote coming from that: whatever solution ends up being made, the most important part is it being *frictionless*. no one wants to be on their phone in front of another person. key theme is making it as easy and seamless as possible - if it's going to work as a second brain to keep track of people in your life, it needs to feel as if the solution is ingrained in your nerves themselves, nothing less.
