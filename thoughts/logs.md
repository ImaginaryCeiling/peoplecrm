There's nothing revolutionary about this product. The differentiation will come from how effectively we can get people to start using it. I think accepting this now is very important.

I think today to get started we'll do some basic CRUD word. I'll try to replicate what I have going on in my notes app at the moment; lets see what happens. Very basic stuff; I'm talking html forms and local storage

ok it's 2:41 am now and i need to be up at 8am so i'm going to call it from here. got the c in crud working and deployed [live](peoplecrm-plglenr2p-arnav-chauhans-projects-fbc8225a.vercel.app). will do the rest later ig

Finally back! Finals are over, so is junior year. thank goodness. now i have time to spend every waking moment working on this. can't wait. to begin, i think i'll spend some time getting the backend setup with a database. authentication works, now to get it set up with supabase to start. i think by this weekend i should hit 15 hours. it's interesting; i've been looking forward to being able to work on this for the past month or so now but now that I have the time I'm looking for ways to put it off? I think it comes from a fear of being able to actually devote myself to one thing for so long - i haven't been able to do that for a while.
